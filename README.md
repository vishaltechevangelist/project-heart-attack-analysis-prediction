# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction

* The medical name of a heart attack is “Myocardial infarction”.
* Heart attack in short; It is the occlusion of the vessel by plaque-like lesions filled with cholesterol and fat.
* The lesion is an abnormal conditions that occur in the organs where the disease is located.
* As a result of the blockage, the blood flow is completely cut off, and a heart attack that can lead to death occurs.

# Symptoms of a Heart Attack
* Chest Pain
* Arm Pain
* Jaw Pain
* Back Pain
* Anxiety
* Nausea
* Fainting/Dizziness
* Sweats

# Variable Definition in the Dataset
1. age - age in years
2. sex - sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp - chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 0 = asymptomatic)
4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (1 = normal; 2 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 0 = hypertrophy)
8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (2 = upsloping; 1 = flat; 0 = downsloping)
12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal - 2 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect
14. num - the predicted attribute - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (Value 0 = < diameter narrowing; Value 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
